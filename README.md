# MarkovPoetry
MarkovPoetry is a Java implementation of Markov chain generation based on long input text, generating short sentences in the "style" of the text using a Markov algorithm.

##Proof of Concept
This is a purely proof of concept program. The code is fine but it's not great. It's fast though. I'll go through and comment it up when I have time.
Just judge the implementation, not the convention-nonconforming code.

##This is a weird implementation I know.

##API
I'll add an easy to use API to this soon.
